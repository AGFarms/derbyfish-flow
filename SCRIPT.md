# Demo Script

## Intro

Hey there. This is DerbyFish's project demo to PLGenesis Hackathon for the decentralized economies finalist track.

DerbyFish is a sportsfishing platform and sanctioning body that aims to become the ultimate fishing hub for the 70 million American fisher men and women. 

In this hackathon, we have built the DerbyFish Tokenomy that all stems from bringing real fish on chain.

To preface, during this hackathon, all users on DerbyFish were made custodial Flow wallets, FishNFT Collections, and each Species Coin Vault 

The components in our tokenomic Model are the Fish (NFT), Fish Cards (NFT), Sepecies Coins (FT), and BaitCoin (stablecoin).

### Fish and Species Coin Minting
1. An angler uses DerbyFish's BHRV virtual fish submission process to catch a fish
2. The sanctioning body, Derby Fish, verifies or approves the fish catch and mints a FishNFT that has public core data, and private catch data (location, technique, weather)
3. The FishNFT allows a user to redeem a species coin of that fish's species

    Note: 1:1 Supply of the FishNFT's in one species and the Species Coin Token Max Supply. Of course Token Supply leq Max Supply

### Fish Card Minting
1. The above
2. Fish Catcher enables and configures Fish Card Minting off there fish
3. Other users purchase Fish Cards and DerbyFish mints Fish Cards with the same core data and random 50/50 coin toss on every private piece of data building in a randomized rarity based on data completeness
4. Trade Fish Cards like pokemon

### FishDEX & Species Coin / BaitCoin Liquidity
1. Anglers that have caught verified fish and redeemed their species coins can redeem their species coins for BaitCoin, our in app currency and stablecoin.
2. DerbyFish sets up liquidity pools for the species coins and brings on other liquidity providers
3. This is the FishDex, the Fish Index and Decentralized Exchange

Think about if the pokedex, coinmarketcap, and opensea all had a real life baby, that would be fishdex.

## Prototype Demo
Now we will go on to show a bit more of what this would look like visually

We split the tabs int My Fish, Explore, and Fishdex

My Fish you can see your fish and fish cards, explore you see other fish and fish cards, and fish dex you see all the tradeable species

## Product Demo

Now we can see how we implemented thes live mainnet contracts into our app.

Every Walleye Fish Submission is a FishNFT and we can see the the biggest 26.25 incher from WalleyeFest 2025 is an NFT here. We have not integrated FishCards, but they are live, functional and in the mainnet contract ready to be integrated.

Next we have the Species coins on the fishdex. If we look at walleye we can see all the information that is on chain.

We look forward to iterating and making this a thriving tokenomy.
