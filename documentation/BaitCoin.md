# BaitCoin Contract Overview

## What is BaitCoin?

BaitCoin is a custom cryptocurrency token built on the Flow blockchain for the DerbyFish ecosystem. It's designed as a 1:1 pegged token with FUSD (a bridged token from Ethereum), meaning 1 BAIT token always equals 1 FUSD token in value. The contract is deployed at address `0xed2202de80195438` on Flow mainnet.

## Key Features

### ü™ô Token Basics
- **Name**: BAIT Coin
- **Symbol**: BAIT
- **Decimals**: 8 (allowing for precise fractional amounts)
- **Total Supply**: Starts at 0 and grows as users swap FUSD for BAIT
- **Website**: https://derby.fish

### üîÑ Token Swapping
The contract enables seamless conversion between FUSD and BAIT tokens:
- **FUSD ‚Üí BAIT**: Users can swap their FUSD tokens for BAIT tokens
- **BAIT ‚Üí FUSD**: Users can swap their BAIT tokens back to FUSD tokens
- **1:1 Exchange Rate**: Always maintains a 1:1 ratio between the tokens

### üè¶ Vault System
- **Personal Vaults**: Each user has their own secure storage for BAIT tokens
- **Contract Vault**: The contract maintains a FUSD vault to facilitate swaps
- **Vault Creation**: Users must run the `createAllVault.cdc` transaction to set up their vaults

## How It Works

### For Regular Users

1. **Getting BAIT Tokens**:
   - First, run `createAllVault.cdc` to set up your BAIT vault
   - Run `swapFusdForBait.cdc` transaction with your desired FUSD amount
   - Receive an equal amount of BAIT tokens in your personal vault
   - Your FUSD is stored in the contract's vault for future swaps

2. **Converting Back to FUSD**:
   - Run `swapBaitForFusd.cdc` transaction with your desired BAIT amount
   - Receive an equal amount of FUSD tokens
   - Your BAIT tokens are "burned" (removed from circulation)

3. **Token Management**:
   - Check your BAIT balance anytime
   - Send BAIT to other users
   - View token information and metadata

### For Administrators

The contract includes special admin functions for:
- **Minting BAIT**: Create new BAIT tokens for specific users (via `adminMintBait.cdc`)
- **Burning BAIT**: Remove BAIT tokens from circulation (via `adminBurnBait.cdc`)
- **Withdrawing FUSD**: Move FUSD from the contract to specific addresses (via `withdrawContractUsdf.cdc`)
- **Updating Metadata**: Change token logo, description, or other information
- **Direct Token Burning**: The `burnTokens()` function reduces total supply without requiring vault access

## Security Features

### üîí Access Control
- **Admin-Only Functions**: Critical operations require admin privileges
- **User Authorization**: Users must authorize transactions involving their tokens
- **Capability System**: Uses Flow's capability system for secure access control

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Checks
- **Balance Verification**: Prevents withdrawing more tokens than available
- **Amount Validation**: Ensures swap amounts are greater than zero
- **Vault Existence**: Checks that required vaults exist before operations
