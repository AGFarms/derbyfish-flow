# BaitCoin Contract Overview

## What is BaitCoin?

BaitCoin is a custom cryptocurrency token built on the Flow blockchain for the DerbyFish ecosystem. It's designed as a 1:1 pegged token with USDF (a bridged token from Ethereum), meaning 1 BAIT token always equals 1 USDF token in value.

## Key Features

### ü™ô Token Basics
- **Name**: BAIT Coin
- **Symbol**: BAIT
- **Decimals**: 8 (allowing for precise fractional amounts)
- **Total Supply**: Starts at 0 and grows as users swap USDF for BAIT
- **Website**: https://derby.fish

### üîÑ Token Swapping
The contract enables seamless conversion between USDF and BAIT tokens:
- **USDF ‚Üí BAIT**: Users can swap their USDF tokens for BAIT tokens
- **BAIT ‚Üí USDF**: Users can swap their BAIT tokens back to USDF tokens
- **1:1 Exchange Rate**: Always maintains a 1:1 ratio between the tokens

### üè¶ Vault System
- **Personal Vaults**: Each user has their own secure storage for BAIT tokens
- **Contract Vault**: The contract maintains a USDF vault to facilitate swaps
- **Automatic Setup**: Vaults are created automatically when needed

## How It Works

### For Regular Users

1. **Getting BAIT Tokens**:
   - Send USDF tokens to the contract
   - Receive an equal amount of BAIT tokens in your personal vault
   - Your USDF is stored in the contract's vault for future swaps

2. **Converting Back to USDF**:
   - Send BAIT tokens to the contract
   - Receive an equal amount of USDF tokens
   - Your BAIT tokens are "burned" (removed from circulation)

3. **Token Management**:
   - Check your BAIT balance anytime
   - Send BAIT to other users
   - View token information and metadata

### For Administrators

The contract includes special admin functions for:
- **Minting BAIT**: Create new BAIT tokens for specific users
- **Burning BAIT**: Remove BAIT tokens from circulation
- **Withdrawing USDF**: Move USDF from the contract to specific addresses
- **Updating Metadata**: Change token logo, description, or other information

## Security Features
